    <h2>From Physical to Digital</h2>
    <p>This is a dryclean family business that has several branch offices in Tijuana, MX. They wanted to substitute
      their actual manual receipts system to a digital application. Translating their current system to an automated
      one helped them to speed up the reception process as well as facilitating their accounts and balance sheets.

  <p>
This project caught my attention because the problem to be solved was quite clear as the ultimate goal of the
discipline of design (there are a few more, of course). Give users more time to do the things that really matter in
life. In the case of Limpiadurias de la O, this meant replacing the physical receipts of orders, by a digital system
of receipts, which by consequence could be automated to even facilitate other tasks such as balance sheets, tracking
order status, creating reports, among others.

<p>
  To better understand how was the process actually being handled, I visited the establishment and observed. I spoke
  with the owner and the goals were defined. The objective was to translate the paper receipts to a web application,
  using the same bases that were already familiar by the receptionists. This is when it became clear to me that when
  you want to make life easier for others, you need to solve the pain points for them. I worked with several versions
   iterating solutions, until I got to the final version which is currently used with satisfaction.
