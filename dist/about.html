<div class="long-story">
  <span class="subtitulo">My Story</span>
<p>As a teenager I didn’t understand why I was so appealed to advertising that moved me and made me feel something.
  After choosing Graphic Design as my career, I did fell in love with the aesthetic part of it, but was lacking of something, a meaning.
  <b>I started out as a designer who designed for designers</b>.
  I cannot call myself a visual designer.
  Making things just visually pretty isn’t my goal nor my motivation.
<br><br>
After acquiring more experience with jobs and a winning participation at a bi-national startup pitch competition,
I understood the process of creating user-centered digital services from scratch and found that something I was lacking of.
<b>Now I am a human that designs for humans</b>.
</p>

<h3>My goal is not to design screens, is to design experiences</h3>

<p>The satisfaction of provoking a smile, or to make an ordinary task a pleasant experience, that’s the real goal.
  My focus is to <b>create work that positively impacts users’ lives</b>. I am professional but do not like to take everything too serious,
  as I do work better with a mind open to many possibilities.
<br><br>
I enjoy <b>team work</b> as I’ve learned that not everyone can design, but great design concepts can come from anyone.
Growing up in the busiest land border crossing in the world has taught me interesting things.
One that I can recall is that even with cultural differences and living in an everchanging digital era, <b>technology changes, humans not</b>.
