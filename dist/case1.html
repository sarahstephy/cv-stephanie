    <h2>A Multi-challenge Approach</h2>
    <p>The client is a New York startup that created a directory and search engine for gyms that allows
    it’s users to search and buy day passes according their preferences of activity and location.
    I was approached to make the design of their logo, landing page and the ux flow of one of their services.

  <p>
    Let’s talk context. I was involved in this project because I freelanced for this cool San Diego-based company
    called ZipDev. I like to call this a multi-challenge since I worked on different aspects of the project.
    The first challenge was to create an attractive visual identity that reflected the main concepts of the service.
    Being this said, the solution given was a fusion of icons that represent physical activities and the location search engine system.

  The second challenge was to create the Visual Interface of the Landing Page, which has a call to action to download the app,
  start searching for gyms near you, and as a gym owner, to get listed as a Zeamo partner gym. The wireframes where mostly
  already made  by one on their team. So the process here was to take the elements that the company wanted to highlight, such
  as the download app link, how it works, about the company and contact form and translate it to a visual design.
  After some variations and testings, this was the result, and of course you are welcome to see it live.

<p>
Ready for the third challenge? Here I worked with the wireframes and user flow of the web platform in which the gym owners
register their establishment, and create / manage the passes they offer. As we live in a world of business ($), and
Zeamo wants to get more and more gyms to join them to have a broader catalog to offer its users, the most wise thing
to do was to make the Gym Owner administration process fluid and easy to follow. The user flow was analyzed and we created
a simple step by step, ending with the passes that were created as cards making it easier to visualize and add or edit.

<span class="subtitulo">My final thoughts</span>
<p>
I really enjoyed working on this project, and I'm really happy to see it live. As an ever-evolving and learning human that I am,
I enjoy collecting small pieces of knowledge with every project. What would I have done differently? Well, I see now with more
clarity that the more you have contact with the real user, the better and more accurate solution you can offer them. At the
time I worked on this project, I didn’t have a clear understanding of the importance of involving the user-testing along with
the project (and love that I’m still learning). If I were to redo this project from zero, I would implement more tasks such as
developing user personas, iterate design deliverables with user testing and design with a mobile-first approach.
